This is my rendition of the popular board game 'Battleship'. This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. A full set of instructions for this project can be found directly on The Odin Project's website https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship. 
Project Battleship is the last project before starting the React section of the curriculum. So it is the last project that will be made using vanilla JavaScript only. The focus of this project was to include Test Driven Development but also, to utilize almost every skill learned up to this point. Tests for this project were created using Jest.
